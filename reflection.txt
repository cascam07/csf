Homework 5: Election prediction


Collaboration:

None

Reflection:

This was by far the most challenging assignment we have had so far. I definitely
felt like my current programming skills were pushed as far as they go in this
assignment. That being said, I also felt like I learned more doing this homework
than on any of the previous assignments. I didn't do a very good job of boxing
my time, as I spent upwards of 9 hours working on this, but I still learned a
great deal in that extra time spent.
