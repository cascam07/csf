Problem 3 – “Defining a Function”

Define a function that takes in 3 parameters that are all integers (x,y,z). The function will multiply x by y and then add the result to z. Then return the result.

Problem 4 - “Dictionaries”

Create a Dictionary that holds the phone numbers for Joe (111-222-3333), Bob (222-333-4444), and Zach (333-444-5555). The names are the keys. Then delete Bob from the list and add Suzy (444-555-6666).

Problem 5 - “Equality of Dictionaries”

Using one or more of the following dictionaries, write two statements using the id function about object equality (one that prints True and one that prints False).
dict1 = {1:2, 3:4, 5:6}
dict2 = {1:2, 3:4, 5:6}
dict3 = dict1

Problem 6 - “Looping”

Use a for loop to add 1 to each item on the following list and print each total.
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Problem 7 – “Nested Looping” 

Create a list of 10 random numbers. Sort them in ascending order using a nested looping structure (selection sort). Don't use list.sort().
