<h3>
Problem 3 Data Structures
</h3>
Python supports several different classes of data structures, including dictionaries, lists, and tuples. These data
structures are declared with different grouping symbols. For example

Dictionaries are declared with {}
Lists are declared with []
Tuples are declared with ()

Within the grouping symbols will be the elements of the data structure.

Dictionary = {0:'cat', 1:'dog', 2:'elephant'}
List = [0, 1, 2, 'bird', 5.0]
Tuples = (0, 5, 7)

For this problem, create a dictionary that uses the days of the week as keys and maps the numbers 0 through 6 to them
in order starting with Sunday:0. Create a second dictionary that uses the months of the year as keys and maps the first
letter of the months name to each.

<h3>
Problem 4 Nested Data Structures
</h3>

You can also nest data structures within other data structures. It is, for example, possible to create a list of dictionaries
or dictionary of tuples.

Create a list that has the two dictionaries from the previous problem as its elements. What are the data types of the
elements of this list? What data types are in the 0th element of the list? The 1st?
